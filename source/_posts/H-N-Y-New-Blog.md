Happy new year every one, I just have time to make my new blog site [rkdev.in.th](https://rkdev.in.th) and move every things from [wordpress site](https://longdreamjourney.wordpress.com/)
For a year never update my blog then I have some expirences with Devops and Web development to be able to make my own blog site
### Technology Stack
1.  Devops
    -   [Github](https://github.com/) - Repository
    -   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - SCM tools
2.  Web Development
    -   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - I think every one know about this
    -   [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) - As they said **"Simple blog framework"**
3. Other
    -   [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) - simple and easy to write

### Source Code
